# as step 5 we have to select a column or row for data manipulation and changes 

# as that use square bracets for that

# then we have to filter the data with using boolean filter by conditions

# selecting a column 
# 1 - a series 
# 2 - dataframe multiple column of data

# colummn = df["column name"]
# subset = df["column1","column2","column3","",...]


# filtering rows
# boolean indexing

# based on single condition
# filtered row = df[df["salary"] > 50000]

# multiple condition
# filtered row = df[(df["salary"] > 50000) & (df["salary"] < 80000)]
